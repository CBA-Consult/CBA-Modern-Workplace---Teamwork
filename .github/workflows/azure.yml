# Download the latest Build from Azure Dev Ops. This action takes arguments related to Azure DevOps build pipeline and downloads the artifact of latest successful build under GITHUB_WORKSPACE, which can be used in the subsequent github workflow step.

# This would be very useful in case of uploading Azure Sec Pack related files to Azure VMs at the time of deployment. 

# Example Usage in the github workflow
# name: Github Workflow

# on: [push]

# jobs:
#  ...

#  # deploy new database schema using dacpac
#  build:
#      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#      steps:
#      # checkout
#      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
#      # download artifact from azure dev ops
#      - name: download artifacts from azure dev ops build pipeline
#        uses: manishsat/ado-download-artifact@v1
